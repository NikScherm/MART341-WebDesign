# Response
## Summarize the work I did 

I worked on learning how to use **Visual Code Studio** to focus on how to properly use a program I previously had experiences in the past. This program gave me trouble with coding in C lanaguage
a few years back.
__What Happened__
1. Odd glitches where the program didn't run my code
2. Losing track of important files and directories for a code
3. Getting it to download properly

   However, *luckily* I did not run into past troubles either because I learned from them or they updated to fix their side glitches.
   I paid attention and listened to which extensions to download.
