All pages are new and this is a remake of Assignment 8 where I felt like I did not have the needed knowledge at the time to make
a close concept to what I had in mind for this type of website.

## Techniques Applied  
I used Bootstrap for the navigation across the entire website. CSS techniques, such as page layout, font customization, custom sizing, and gallery styling, were all implemented in the external stylesheet.  

- Margins
- EM Units: Used to adjust font sizes dynamically without affecting padding or other related elements.  
- !important: Applied to override Bootstrap's default styles when necessary.  

Embedded media, such as videos, is included on three pages: Cass, Move, and Index. Images are strategically placed throughout the website, including in the gallery, introduction, banner, and other sections.  

To improve readability and organization, I used semantic HTML markup to break the code into sections and added comments for reference. The site's structure is enhanced with headers, line breaks, alignment, and grid systems.  

JavaScript is used to implement a "Back to Top" button, improving the user-friendly experience.
