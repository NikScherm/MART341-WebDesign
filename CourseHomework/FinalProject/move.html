            <h2> What is an Art Movement? </h2>
<br>
<p>  
    An art movement is a collective style or trend in art, often characterized by a shared philosophy, technique, or approach that is followed by a group of artists during a specific period. These movements typically arise in response to cultural, political, or social changes and may challenge or expand upon previous artistic conventions. Art movements often represent a shift in how art is made, interpreted, or appreciated, with artists in a particular movement working toward common goals or themes, even if their individual works are diverse.

For example, the Impressionist movement in the late 19th century focused on capturing light and movement with loose brushwork, while **Abstract Expressionism** in the mid-20th century emphasized emotion and spontaneous creation through non representational forms. Movements help categorize art history and understand the evolution of artistic thought and practice over time.

<h2> American Art Movements</h2>
<p> 
    Over the past 200 years, American art has evolved through a series of distinctive movements. In the early 19th century, the Hudson River School, led by artists like Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, emphasized romantic landscapes that celebrated the natural beauty of the American wilderness. By the late 19th century, artists were increasingly influenced by European styles, as seen in the rise of Realism and Impressionism in the U.S., with painters such as Winslow Homer and Mary Cassatt exploring everyday life and light effects.

In the 20th century, American art gained international recognition with the advent of movements like Abstract Expressionism, led by Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko in the post-World War II era. This style emphasized bold, non representational forms. Pop Art in the 1960s, driven by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, reflected a growing fascination with consumer culture. Later, movements such as Minimalism and Conceptual Art, as well as more recent explorations of identity and social issues, have continued to shape American art into the 21st century.
Keep in mind that art from America is multicultural.    </div>
