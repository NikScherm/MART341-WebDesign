I added divs to help separate the titles and selections throughout the page. The video and audio elements enhance the context of the page. I used spans to highlight important information and to indicate specific locations on the page.

I’m particularly proud of the index hover menu. Although it's not fancy, it was a bit of a challenge to create, and I spent quite a while fixing an issue where the pop-up was off-center. It turns out that a div was causing the problem, which I resolved.

I also like using iframes and incorporated them to embed videos. However, finding public domain images or proper information about them was more difficult. I ended up using Wiki Commons, which provides that information.

I really like the class function and applied it to other parts of the website. As for the hover menu, I’m not sure if I would attempt it on every page just yet. Class function was used to center text and add more style to the overall text and in some areas just align.
I did use it on hover menu but that is outside the page I worked on.
