# What I worked on
**I worked on the pages mission.html and index.html, along with adding fonts to the fonts folder and adding more styles to styles.css in the css folder.**

## Techniques applied
- I added different font weights to Tinos and Arvo fonts.
- #pagetitl has a text decoration that is underlined, though I could not figure out why ::before was adding non-underlined space.
- Page titles have h2::before and h2::after adding dots around the titles and sections.
- Hover effects were added to the menu at the top, along with an underline on the text.
- I self-hosted Tinos font and added two other fonts from a hosted website.
- Text is aligned to the center for the most part.

The Mission page is just a basic company page for the website.
