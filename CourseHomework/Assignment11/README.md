#What I worked on
**I worked on page mission.html and index.html, along with adding fonts to fonts folder and adding more to styles.css in css folder.**
##Technique applied
- I added different font weights to tinos and arvo fonts.
- #pagetitl has text decoration that is underlined. Though, I could not figure out why 
::Before was adding non-underlined space
- Page titles have  on h2 ::before and ::after adding dots around the titles and sections
- Hovering is added to the menu at the top along with underline on the text
-Self hosted Tinos font and added other two from a hosted website.
-Text is aligned to the center for the most part

Mission page is just a basic company page for the website.
