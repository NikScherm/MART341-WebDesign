**Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?**
A: Web browsers function by rendering and interpreting the content on the web pages. They process HTML to
 display the content and structure like images and text on pages. The browser's processor 
for tags is then passed to a DOM, a representation of the doc that connects with scripts and 
style info to render a page properly.

**What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages?**
A: DOM is an interface which defines the structure of a web doc in logical format (tree) which 
consists of nodes and objects. The nodes represent the elements on the page like images and text.
DOM allows programming languages such as Javascript to modify the structure and content of a web page.
It provides a way of accessing and altering elements which allows for interactive features and real-time
updates or changes.

**HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?**
A: 
HTML is the foundation language for creating web pages and uses standard tags to 
structure content rendering for web browsers.

XML does not render content instead tags data in text format for shading between applications.

XHTML has features that are a blend of the other two, it provides strict rules for writing a
markup. It corrects behaviors in HTML and in the process ensuring the code is more precise, especially on mobile devices.

**What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?**
``A: The four essential elements are <!doctype HTML>, <HTML>,<head>, and <body>.``

**What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?**
A: The index.html page is normally the homepage of a website which contains content that users will see first.
It should be placed in the root directory and not it other folders attached to the root so it can function.

**Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?**
Naming should be clear and consistent including how we use lowercase, uppercase, and spelling. 
There should be no spaces or usage of underscores, instead use hyphens. Avoid using numeric
starts and do not use funky symbols/characters.
