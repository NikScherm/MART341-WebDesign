# What I worked on
I worked on all 4 pages with scripts and styles.css

## Techniques applied

**There are two java scripts I worked on:**
1.) Canvas is used to add gradient to the header text with white outline. (HTML 5)
2.) After looking through the java website, I decided to use back to the top (Java functionality)
button for the script to be applied to my website. 

**Framework Integration:**

Using bootstrap for the layout of the menu area
Framework Styling:
I used the navigation bar with a drop down menu within the bootstrap.
