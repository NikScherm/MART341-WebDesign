# Reflection
The aspect of my website I am most proud of right now is how I set up the gallery of images. I have not yet done galleries and
I had some troubles working with margins and getting things to align. I finally got it to fit in within the div margin. I like how it looks for a simple website. Galleries are important for art website for viewing images online. The functionality also allows people to click on the image to view it as bigger version in some cases. The neutral background aids people in seeing the artwork, I tried to avoid using so much color that is outside of neutral palette so most of it is brown and tan. I enjoy the home feel to the colors that I used while not ground breaking they still look nice together. I decided to also add navigation as its own page as it expands it will need a lot of space but I do think navigation for website outside of artists and art movement should be added later on. I am happy with the choice on that page being its own as I can organize it a lot easier so people can find artists or art movements in the future.
