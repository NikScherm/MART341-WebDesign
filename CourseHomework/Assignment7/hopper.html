<h2 style="color:brown;"> About Hopper</h2>
<br>
<p> Periods: Realism, Impressionism, Modern art, Ashcan School</p>
<o1>
    Edward Hopper was a keen observer of everyday life, transforming it into tense and enigmatic artworks that focused on the psychological realities of his subjects. He spent most of his time in downtown New York and Cape Cod, where his reflective and individualistic nature shaped his art. Though known as a leading realist painter of 20th-century America, Hopper's vision of reality was selective, emphasizing mood over literal representation.

    Born in 1882 in New York, Hopper studied art from 1900 to 1906 and later transitioned from illustration to fine art. His travels to Paris between 1906 and 1910 profoundly influenced him, especially his encounter with Impressionism. This experience shifted his artistic style, moving away from dark, old master techniques to brighter, light-infused works.
    
    After returning to the U.S. in 1910, Hopper struggled to gain recognition, with most of his early success coming from etchings rather than oil paintings. His breakthrough came at age 37 with a solo exhibition at the Whitney Club, followed by greater success at the Frank K.M. Rehn Gallery in New York. These exhibitions helped elevate his career and establish him as a major figure in American art.
