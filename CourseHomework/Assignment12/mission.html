        <h2 style="color:#155d5f;"> About the Owners</h2>
        <p class="text1">Meredith Ann Lenley and Bruce Lenley, a couple in their late 50s, have always shared a passion for community, creativity, and connection. After decades spent working in corporate roles, they decided to pursue their dream of opening Ma's and Pa's Giftshop to combine their love for thoughtful gifts with their desire to serve their community. Inspired by cherished family traditions and the joy of giving, Meredith and Bruce wanted to create a shop that celebrates life's milestones and little moments alike. They believe that a gift shop should be a place where everyone feels welcome, whether they're browsing for the perfect birthday present or simply enjoying a stroll through the aisles of beautiful, one-of-a-kind items. For Meredith and Bruce, Ma's and Pa's is more than a business; it’s a heartfelt expression of their belief in the importance of shared experiences and the joy of finding just the right gift.</p>
