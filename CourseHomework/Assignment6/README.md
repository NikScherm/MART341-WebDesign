## I picked Small Company
I picked the small company because the skills which you can learn from doing a website like this. Majority of the skills need to be learned and worked with before doing personal projects. It is something not too complex for someone who does not know much about HTML and CSS.
## Reflection
I applied balance concepts by adding white space (in this case its light blue) to keep things easily separated and readable. I adjusted the background to be light blue to keep in on the contrast side it is on a lighter value but is not as blinding as white.

This is not really the goal for the website just yet, the idea is there in spirit but it does not look good. There are a lot of missing skills needed like knowing css or how to properly align and put stuff within a grid. I had to make some adjustments like trying to add more margin to the title and shifting the image to the left to make better use of the space.
-
Margin for the image was a bit tricky since I added sizing to it, I realized I do not know what order stuff has to go into or if it
needs an order at all. It wasn't horrible I wish to float to other sides but for this naturally people tend to read right to left.
-
I did face some challenge trying to use div for the first time. I had to relook over the code on the website and realize I missed a few
things. I fixed it after I read through it carefully.
