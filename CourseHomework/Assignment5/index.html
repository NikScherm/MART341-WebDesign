<h1> Brainstorm for Websites</h1>
<hr> 

<h2> Recipe Book Blog</h2>
<p> A website where you can share your favorite dishes to cook with pictures of them that is fun with color pastels accents. Giving instructions for basics of classic recipes like
    sugar cookies or eggrolls. Using blog method where each recipe instructions gets its own blog page. Along with a page telling people basic
    cooking tips and things to avoid when learning how to cook. This is a good way to show that someone can do a blog type website with the goal
    of educating people on how to cook. This is a good way to show that you can be hired for professional websites that are not entirely corporate owned
    instead privately owned. These types of websites are good showcase for clients who want blogging website in the future.

<h2> Learn to Draw Website </h2>
<p> This website needs to be fun and light with some professionalism in its tone. The goal for the website would to have basic resources and written guides to 
    aid people in learning how to draw in terms of basics. This idea focuses on people who are completely new being able to find guiding pathway to learning basics of drawing down. Things like tutorials, guides, and resources will each have their 
    own page and can guide the user using a site index with suggestion page to aid the user in selecting where to go each step.

<h2> Informational website for a Small local Business </h2>
<p> A website that purpose is to offer information to customers about their busines, opening times ,and prices. The tone should be professional with
    some on brand theme like if they sold a comic book it will have some fun tones or if they are tax business it will have more serious tones.
    Website should be a page that shares information with audience that people typically google and try to look for: information regarding
    services, products, time openings, and other common questions. This should have a mission statement, about us, social media links, and 
    good showcase what the business actually does.
