<h1> Why I picked these ideas</h1>
<hr>
<h2> Recipe Book Blog</h2>
<p> The goal of this website is because I know someone who is interested in sharing their recipes with the world. This would be an 
    easy way to go about doing that. Creating a visually fun platform that showcases photos,recipes, and cooking tips.  Outside my 
    personal interest this also applies to future clients that are interested in starting a blog.

<h2> Learn to Draw Website </h2>
<p> Education websites are part of the reason why the internet is great. Learning a new hobby can cost money, the reason I picked this idea
    is because art is often blocked by paid courses, classes, and a lot of people telling you need to buy stuff. This website would be
    more aligned with my personal interest in aiding people to learn a new skill online for free other than them giving their time.

<h2> Informational website for a Small local Business </h2>
<p> This one is I picked because I often see this no matter where I go, it is an universal issue. A lot of people do not have websites
    for their businesses which is not ideal for this day and age of people using internet to look up information. I found it is common
    thing that a lot of businesses do not know they need and this would be a good way to learn how to make a professional website for a company.
