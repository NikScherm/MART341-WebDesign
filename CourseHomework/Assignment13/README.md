# What I worked on
All pages on the document, the newest page is findart.html and index.html was replaced to be a home screen.

## Techniques applied

@media techniques were used to ensure that the website was mobile friendly. Using sizing like flex for the main content area to help it fix into tablet, mobile, and desktop view while maintaining that it is readable. Embedded content did not need to be adjusted in size.
The images, text, sections, and title background had to be adjusted in code. Images and text are resized and coded to ensure they do not get cut off by the screen changes. 

### Aligning all adjustments:

  justify-content: center; > Horizonal alignment for content.
    align-items: center; > Vertical aligmment for content.
    These type are all around the code to keep things in middle of the screen for better focal points.

### Flex Items

flex-wrap: wrap; This allows this to stack the column.
Flex 80% and Flex 20% allows the sizing to adjust a lot
easier in tablet and mobile view.

## Styles.css

The style.css made it so all the pages were the same to keep consistent layout through the entire website.
