# What I worked on
I worked on all pages in terms of working with styles.css and added a page products.html

## Techniques applied

Sizing is done throughout the pages in images, text, etc.

Overflow is used in the main content area to ensure no content is outside the borders of the area.

A border was added around the main content area to give it a bit of style.

Margins and padding are added in headers, main content area, text, and footer to make sure that 
there is white space (negative) so things are easier on the eyes.

The drop-down menu and welcome block both use inline.

The horizontal menu has been replaced with a hover menu.

The position is used in areas like drop-down menu to ensure the position is functional like appearing right under the Menu button.
