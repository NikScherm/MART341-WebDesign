                Style is what makes an artist stand out within their community. Whether artists work in realism, semi-realism, anime, cartoons, or any other genre, their unique style can make their work recognizable and distinctive among others in similar fields.
            
                Style emerges from the way an artist uses lines, color, shapes, and other elements. This personal touch can vary widely, allowing artists to develop styles that may be similar to others or entirely unique.
                
                As you continue to improve, shaping your style into something that you truly enjoy drawing will help solidify your artistic voice. Finding and refining this style is an ongoing journey, one that evolves as you grow.

                <h2 class="title1">Anime</h2>
            
                <p>Anime is a popular art style originating from Japan, known for its expressive character designs, vibrant colors, and unique stylistic elements. Anime typically features large, emotive eyes, exaggerated facial expressions, and dynamic poses that convey emotion and action. While character proportions can vary, they often have simplified facial features, with hair and clothing depicted in stylized shapes. This style is widely used in animated series, films, and manga, and its influence has spread globally, inspiring a variety of interpretations in fan art and professional art alike.</p>

                    -->
                <h2 class="title1">Realism</h2>
            
                <p>Realism aims to represent subjects as accurately and true-to-life as possible. Artists working in this style pay close attention to details, capturing textures, lighting, and proportions to create lifelike depictions. Realism can include various genres, from portraits and landscapes to still life. This style requires strong observational skills and a deep understanding of anatomy, perspective, and shading to achieve a naturalistic effect. Realism is commonly seen in fine art, portraiture, and classical art but is also prevalent in digital and concept art.</p>

                <h2 class="title1">Western Cartoon</h2>
            
                <p>Western cartoon style refers to the art style commonly found in animated series, comics, and graphic novels originating from Western countries, particularly the U.S. and Europe. This style often emphasizes exaggerated features, bold outlines, and bright colors to create characters that are highly expressive and instantly recognizable. Characters in this style are frequently simplified, with features that highlight specific traits‚Äîlike large, round eyes for innocence or exaggerated jawlines for strength. Western cartoons vary widely, from the iconic looks of Disney and Warner Bros. to more contemporary shows, but they all prioritize visual appeal and storytelling clarity.</p>

                <h2 class="title1">Semi-Realism</h2>
            
                <p>Semi-realism combines elements of realism with stylization to create artwork that feels both grounded and expressive. This style maintains realistic proportions and anatomy but allows for artistic liberties in color, linework, and detail. Artists may use bold colors, simplified lines, or exaggerated expressions to highlight certain aspects of the subject without sacrificing a sense of realism. Semi-realism is commonly used in fantasy and character concept art because it strikes a balance between realistic detail and creative freedom, making it adaptable for storytelling and world-building.</p>

                <h2 class="title1">Graphic Novel Style</h2>
                
                <p>Graphic novel style encompasses a wide range of artistic approaches but generally includes elements suited to visual storytelling and long-form narratives. This style often features strong linework, distinctive shading, and varied panel compositions that support the flow of a story. Graphic novels can range from highly detailed, realistic artwork to minimalist, stylized illustrations, depending on the tone of the story. Shading, color palettes, and visual effects are used to create mood and convey plot. The style is adaptable, lending itself to various genres like drama, horror, fantasy, and more, each with a distinct visual language to enhance the narrative.</p>
