<h1 class="title1"> Finding Your Art Style</h1>

<br>

    Style is what makes an artist stand out among their communities. Even if people draw realism, semi-realism, anime, cartoons, etc.  They can still stick out on how they do things in their communities.  Style is born from how an artist uses lines, color, and shapes. 
    You can have styles similar to yours or completely different. As you become better and better you need to start to shape your style into something that you like to draw.
    <br>
    Don't worry about being unique.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 class="title1"> How to shape your style?</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Step 1, </b> you need to expand what art you have seen if you haven't seen much of other professional artists‚Äô work. To search you can either dig through Google Images, Twitter, IG, Tumblr Searches, DeviantArt suggestions/favorites, or you can look at another author/mangaka/animator/etc. work. Find 3-5 artists who work you like the most. They don't need to be the same type of art and they can always change in what you like.  <br>
    <br>
    <b> Step 2,</b>break down the Characteristics you like and do not like in the style ( Characteristics can be key traits that an artist does in lines, color, and shapes.)
    
    Begin to define why these specific artists....

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy 5th Anniversary Arknights! Time flies when you are having fun! üòéüçâüçπ‚õ±Ô∏èI wish for more years ahead where Mizuki and Goldenglow live out happy days with doctor!ü™º‚òîÔ∏èüêà‚ö°Ô∏è <a href="https://t.co/ax3nQ73VtB">pic.twitter.com/ax3nQ73VtB</a></p>&mdash; Namie (@nambarimasu) <a href="https://twitter.com/nambarimasu/status/1783888772826083819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You may look at Namiekun's work and decide that you enjoy the shading and overall themes. You do not enjoy how she draws faces as it is too simple for your own taste. You take the things you like about her work and see how you can add it to yours.
<br>
<h3 class="title1"> Jordan Grimmer</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sketch. <a href="https://t.co/xwNdh6xmW0">pic.twitter.com/xwNdh6xmW0</a></p>&mdash; Jordan Grimmer (@jordan_grimmer) <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_grimmer/status/1654264634755411968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
You look at Grimmer's work and appreciate that the palettes which are soft and calming to see. Yet even in this you do not like how simple everything is.

<br>
<h3 class="title1"> Craig Mullins</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Detail of paint, about 75% resolution. <a href="https://t.co/4T9V7m01ih">pic.twitter.com/4T9V7m01ih</a></p>&mdash; Craig Mullins (@craigmullins3) <a href="https://twitter.com/craigmullins3/status/1740491642766004306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
You enjoy how Craig Mullins draws his faces within his pieces and that his detailing is vague yet detailed. You do not care for his color palettes as some of them can be too harsh or realistic for your taste.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<b> Step 3,</b> take a more critical lens and look past just basic stuff.


<ul>
    <h2 class="title1"> What you need to ask yourself:</h2>
    <li>What do I like and dislike about their composition?</li>
    <li>What do I like and dislike about their values, colors, and lighting?</li>
    <li>What do I like and dislike about their style of anatomy, faces, and expressions?</li>
    <li>What do I like and dislike about their harmony and overall style of coloring?</li>
    <li>What are the main characteristics I like about their work and also dislike about their work?</li>
</ul>
Of course, your likes will change however, it is good to know what makes someone's work appealing to you. You can steal characteristics from others then start learning how to make them come together. You should always find  3 or more artists you love or like the most to take from.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b> Step 4,</b> try to revisit this concept every year or so. As we grow our taste changes and maybe we become more open-minded or perhaps, even more closed-minded. It is also good to track what was inspiring you through out your journey.
<br>
<br>
These are all the four steps and you may be wondering why we need direction or look at other people's art this way.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2 class="title1"> Why we need direction for styles?</h2>
It is good to learn what makes a style great to us even if there are characteristics we don't like about that style. What style you aim to have is called a " Goal Style." It helps people get on track to learn the fundamentals that they need to know for that specific style. (Ex. someone who wants to draw only animals will not need to know how to draw human anatomy. )
Even if they are just starting art a " Goal style" is needed.  When you first start out you don't have an actual style. Your work is a reflection of your mistakes and that is okay.  Just work on getting basic fundamentals you need to learn the " Goal Style" you have set for yourself. Mistakes are natural but in order to improve you have to learn from them and avoid repeating them.  For people who are still learning art, it will take a while and can be disappointing when you still haven't reached any near the "Goal Style," after 3 years. Art is hard work and a lot of artists take years and years to gain to their goals. A journey for art is a long path for everyone.  In the end, the " Goal Style," is something we need to aim for because it is possible and it gives a direction to focus on in terms of fundamentals.  So when you think you are ready, go find out what style you should aim for.
